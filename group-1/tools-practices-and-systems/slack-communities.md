# Slack Communities



* Slack hacks and workarounds
* What are the best practices for setting up communities using Slacks?&#x20;
  * Thinking specifically about the TRE community Slack - how do we attract people who aren't there yet and make it a vibrant space?&#x20;
  * Consider how you want the Slack to be used: a space for discussion, technical updates, a mix of both?&#x20;
    * Is the discussion best suited to Slack? Or are we defaulting there because it's the technology we're most familiar with?&#x20;
  * &#x20;Be intentional in setting up the space operationally:&#x20;
    * Intro greetings&#x20;
    * Vetting of people to join
    * Channels to set up
    * Think about how to tackle technical issues re: joining and invitations&#x20;
    * Consider integrations and automated reminders&#x20;
  * Try to understand how people are using Slack already, are they familiar with the format and how to use it to engage?&#x20;
    * If people aren't familiar, can disengage and not check&#x20;
    * Can use events to engage and promote the Slack which has been useful for driving initial engagement
    * How to seed discussion?&#x20;
  * Engaging people in the Slack workspaces
    * Needs some orchestrating and nudging, takes some work to drive traffic and build a community &#x20;
    * Seeding discussions after events, or by posting regular updates &#x20;
    * Often people like being able to lurk - not everyone will become a regular poster in every Slack they join!&#x20;
