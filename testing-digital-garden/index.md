# ðŸŒ± Digital Gardens

Last week a colleague of mine introduced me to the concept of [digital gardens](https://maggieappleton.com/garden) - spaces on the web for notes, half-formed thoughts, media, and snippets of writing which don't belong on blogs or for being chucked into the endless screaming void of social media. I was quite taken with the idea since I have multiple notebooks with "useful notes" in them that I have long sine forgotten and with minimal ability to retrieve. I'm hoping a digital garden might help me to keep track of things more easily and help to develop ideas, link concepts, etc etc.

I'm starting with GitHub connected to GitBook as a lot of my notes nowadays are in [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/) (or Google docs) and my coding skills are still currently minimal. Hopefully, over time I'll be able to customise this space more as my skills improve!&#x20;
