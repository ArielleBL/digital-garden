# On Twitter & Immigration

Twitter right now is weird: a funeral wake where the subject is still alive, just. Its chaotic breakdown since 27 October, has been livestreamed to an audience of millions through leaked emails, saluting emojis, Titanic memes, and spicy tweets from senior leadership.&#x20;

On Wednesday 16 November, Elon Musk, currently live action role playing as a tech CEO with one of the world's largest social media platforms, issued an ultimatum to the remaining workers at Twitter. In the email, Musk invited staff to be part of "hardcore" Twitter 2.0: long hours, aggressive deadlines, and engineers revered above all else. If people wanted to stay to build something great, they should hit the "Yes" button in the email. If reports from journalists are to be believed, 75% of remaining staff "missed" the 48 hour deadline to sign up.  \


This follows a tumultuous 3 weeks, where Musk has fired thousands of workers across the globe (with minimal regard for labour laws), overseen the rollout of "Twitter Blue" (which deserves its own separate article), and insisted that programmers at the company print out Twitter's code so that he could review it, in a move more David Brent than Steve Jobs. He's also ordered the company "back to the office" while simultaneously locking everyone out due to sabotage fears.

If that sounds exhausting, imagine actually still working there.&#x20;

So who are the people currently signed up to Twitter 2.0? Arguably more importantly, why haven't the employees left at Twitter simply ignored Musk and taken over control of the company for themselves? One of the simpler and most frustrating reasons is that remaining employees are predominantly tech workers on H1B and other temporary US visas, that are tied explicitly to their employment at Twitter. If they get fired or laid off, they have 60 days to find another job, at a time when thousands of people from the same company are also looking, or their visa expires. \


It's yet another example of workers being trapped and robbed of their agency to organise because their immigration status is directly reliant on their current job. In common with many migrant workers in the UK, if they lose their job in retaliation for pushing back on unfair, unsafe, and illegal work practices, they face deportation away from friends, family, and the lives they've built. It doesn't matter if you're a programmer or a domestic worker, work-based visas are deliberately designed to harm the ability of people to organise in their workplaces.&#x20;

\


That's why it's important for socialists and the left to continue pushing for freedom of movement, for everyone, rather than "skills" or "needs-based" visas, tied to specific workplaces. The latter are regressive stop-gaps that principally serve the needs of capital ahead of workers rights, or their livelihoods. The former allows workers to organise and rebel against the bosses without fear of imminent deportation, encouraging the solidarity in action we need to see.
